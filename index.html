							<p>
									With the introduction of Reliance Jio and its strategy, companies like Idea and Vodafone were in a great tension. Jio was using a strategy to hand out freebies to win over customers which was a competition caught by surprise, resulting in heavy losses for the establishment! Reliance Jio has already gathered 20% of revenue market share in just a matter of 2 years. That is when the merger of Vodafone and idea was when the initial idea came up. It was the need of the hour with Jio rapidly swallowing a major chunk of their customers!

							<p>
								In many ways, to just give an opinion on something is very easy but to back it up with sound facts is a task. A
								task not many are particularly skilled at. But we at EDC VIIT tend not to just throw away our opinions into the
								public. We make sure to explain facts and generate interest among our viewers.

							</p>


							<p>
								One hot topic that almost everyone has an opinion about is “dollar vs. Rupee”. Every morning you read the
								conversion rates in the news while sipping hot tea. Every evening you discuss the depreciating value of the
								Indian Rupee, coincidentally again while sipping your evening tea. But most of these conversations are rather
								baseless at times and can’t really gauge the real situation. What exactly is the dynamic between dollar and
								rupee? How exactly is the rate governed? Most importantly, will the scenario $1=₹1 be a good one or a bad one?
								Read on and find out!

							<h2><a href="blogpost16.html" class="sizereducer">HR as an Asset</a></h2>
							<p>
								The past decade has seen a transition of start-ups from being product-based to service-based. The product based
								startup industry has now almost exhausted and the focus is now shifted to service-based start-ups.
								Consequently, there has been a rise in the demand for human resources. As, before there were more of product
								based startups, physical assets like plants, machinery, etc. were of utmost importance. In contrast, now as the
								shift has been towards service based, the knowledge and attitude of the employees have gained more importance.
								Human resources have truly proven to important for the company as it is solely responsible for the effective
								utilization of all the physical as well as financial resources. Better the quality of human resources of a
								company better would be its management and utilization of its resources. Hence, human resources contribute to
								the overall net worth of the company. Some companies fail to manage their human resources efficiently through
								conventional accounting methods which results in the new position called Human Resources Accounting.
